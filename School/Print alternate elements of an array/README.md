School Accuracy: 50.02% Submissions: 47306 Points: 0

You are given an array A of size N. You need to print elements of A in alternate order (starting from index 0).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
â€‹Output:
1 3

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
â€‹Output:
1 3 5

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you just need to complete the provided function void print(int ar[],int n)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 105

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
